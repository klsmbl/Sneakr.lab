      "question": "What is the production process of custom shoes?",
      "answer": "At Sneakr, we use an innovative process to create fully custom branded footwear. Our process involves setting the physical shoe parts up to match your design, printing on all parts, drying the parts, sewing the parts together, forming the shoe, sealing the shoe to preserve the design, heat treating again, and then finally shipping off. The entire process typically takes 10 business days from order to shipment.",
